/**
 * Will be able to convert some of the below described rules from

 *
 *
 * RULES
 *
 * Every ([n])
 *       day(s)
 *     | [weekday], ..., (and) [weekday]
 *     | weekday(s)

 *
 * on [weekday], ..., (and) [weekday]
 *

 * on the [nth-weekday], ..., (and) [nth-weekday] (of the month/year)
 *
 *
 * Plus 0 or 1 of these:
 *

 *
 * Plus (.)
 *
 *
 * Definitely no supported for parsing:
